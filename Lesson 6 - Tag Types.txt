"""
Your task is to explore the data a bit more.
Before you process the data and add it into MongoDB, you should
check the "k" value for each "<tag>" and see if they can be valid keys in MongoDB,
as well as see if there are any other potential problems.

We have provided you with 3 regular expressions to check for certain patterns
in the tags. As we saw in the quiz earlier, we would like to change the data model
and expand the "addr:street" type of keys to a dictionary like this:
{"address": {"street": "Some value"}}
So, we have to see if we have such tags, and if we have any tags with problematic characters.
Please complete the function 'key_type'.
