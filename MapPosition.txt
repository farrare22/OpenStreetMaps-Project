I choose to wrangle the Fern Creek/Highview suburbs of Louisville, KY.  
I choose Fern Creek/Highview in Lousiville because I currently live here with my family.

The OSM URL: https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/38.1443/-85.6040

Data was downloaded using Overpass API: http://overpass-api.de/api/map?bbox=-85.6824,38.1058,-85.5361,38.1719

The resulting data file is 86.1 MB.
